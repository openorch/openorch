SINGULATRON_HOST_FOLDERâ€‹ This envar is needed when Singulatron runs as a container next to containers it starts: Host | |-&gt; Singulatron Container |-&gt; Container Launched By Singulatron To be able persist data, a host folder must be mounted by all containers. In our example (SINGULATRON_HOST_FOLDER=/var/lib/docker/volumes/singulatron-data/_data) we basically pass down the full path of the singulatron-data volume we created in the docker compose file to the containers created by Singulatron. So cycle goes like this: Singulatron container writes to /root/.singulatron, which is mounted on host at /var/lib/docker/volumes/singulatron-data/_dataAssets (which are basically downloaded files) will be passed to containers created by Singulatron by mounting files in /var/lib/docker/volumes/singulatron-data/_data. SINGULATRON_LLM_HOSTâ€‹ When Singulatron is running in a container, it needs to know how to address its siblings (other containers it started): Host | |-&gt; Singulatron Container |-&gt; Container Launched By Singulatron The Singulatron Container uses the envar SINGULATRON_LLM_HOST to address Container Launched By Singulatron. Typically this value should be 172.17.0.1 if you are using the default docker network. If you are using an other network than default, use docker network inspect to find out the IP of your docker bridge for that network. Usually it's going to be 172.18.0.1. This envar is not needed if Singulatron runs directly on the host: Host With Singulatron | |-&gt; Container Launched By Singulatron SINGULATRON_DBâ€‹ You can use this envar to make Singulatron actually use a database instead of local file storage to store data.
