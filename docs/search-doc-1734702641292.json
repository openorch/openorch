Similarly to Firebase. This page is a high level overview of the Dynamic Svc. For more details, please see the Dynamic Svc API documentation. Aimed at prototyping or where building a service to store the data feels like an overkill. It doesn't aim to be a definitive and exclusively used datastore by any means. Currently the Dynamic Svc is being used with internal apps but the goal is to have a permission model that works for public apps (where adversarial users might be present). If you find a logical inconsitency that hinders building public apps, please report it. How It Works​ Data Model​ Multiple tenants (users, services) write to the same table/s. Rows are then owned by whoever created them and access is dictated by the permissions, see Permission Model below. Permission Model​ The Dynamic Svc has a permission model with the following goals: Be simple &amp; easy to understandBe as versatile as possible while being simple To understand the permission model, lets disect an example entry: { &quot;authors&quot;: [&quot;usr_12345&quot;, &quot;org_67890&quot;], &quot;data&quot;: {}, &quot;deleters&quot;: [&quot;usr_12345&quot;], &quot;id&quot;: &quot;pet_67890&quot;, &quot;readers&quot;: [&quot;org_67890&quot;], &quot;table&quot;: &quot;pet&quot;, &quot;writers&quot;: [&quot;org_67890&quot;] } Readers​ Readers are user ids, organization ids or role ids that can read the entry. You can specify other users' IDs or IDs of organizations you are not part of. This can sometimes cause &quot;spam&quot; in multitenant applications where adversarial entities can be present on the same platform. To fix this issue, see the authors field. Authors​ The authors field simply marks which user or organization created the entry. This field is used to avoid &quot;spam&quot;. In certain platforms spam is because anyone can &quot;offer&quot; a record to be read by an other user or organizations they are not part of. Sometimes this behaviour is undesired: imagine a chat application where strangers spam messages just by knowing the company ID. The Authors field fixes this. Writers​ Writers are user ids, organization ids or role ids that can edit entry. Deleters​ Deleters are user ids, organization ids or role ids that can delete the entry. Conventions​ Table Name and Record ID​ The ID of a record must be prefixed by the table name. For this reason, use singular table names if possible. { &quot;table&quot;: &quot;pet&quot;, &quot;id&quot;: &quot;pet_67890&quot; } ","keywords":"ai  llm  free gpt  gpt  open-source  open source  ai framework  ai server","version":"Next"},{"title":"Registry Svc","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/built-in-services/registry-svc","content":"Registry Svc The registry service is designed to maintain a database of services, service instances and nodes.

The daemon can then lauch service instances or other processes such as containers on these machines. Maintaining a list of nodes is important so the daemon can efficiently distribute workload across the nodes. How It Works​ The registry is needed when you want to call services not included in the OpenOrch daemon. You can think of the daemon as the standard library and services in the registry as third party libraries. When you want to call a service, you can ask the registry to provide you with a list of instance addresses for a service by service slug. Then you can use any of those instance addresses to make a call.

Responsibilities​ Provide tools for service writers to prevent adversarial users from causing service degradation How It Works​ The Policy Svc requires you to explicitly call the /policy-svc/check endpoint in every service endpoint you are building.

Each service and human on an OpenOrch network has an account in the User Svc. This page is a high level overview of the User Svc. For more details, please see the User Svc API documentation. How it works​ The most important thing about the User Svc is that service (machine) and user (human) accounts look and function the same. Every service you write needs to register at startup, or log in with the credentials it saves and manages if it's already regsitered. Just like a human. A service account is not an admin account, it's a simple user level account. You might wonder how service-to-service calls work then. Service-to-service calls​ Service to service calls are made possible by simply whitelisting service slugs. At the moment this is only a static whitelist, but to whitelist your own custom services to be able to call built-in services a dynamic mechanism will be introduced. Services with multiple nodes​ You might now wonder what happens when a service has multiple instances/nodes. Won't their user accounts &quot;clash&quot; in the User Svc? The answer to this is that from the User Svc point of view, each node/instance of a service is the same account. This is possible because the platform is designed with services having a &quot;Shared Database Access&quot;. Let's say you have a Cassandra network that spans multiple Availability Zones/Regions. Your nodes will also span multiple AZs/Regions and each instance of them will log in as X Svc. The token​ The User Svc produces a JWT (JSON Web Token) upon /user-svc/login in the token.token field (see the response documentation). You can either use this token as a proper JWT - decode it and inspect the contents, or you can just use the token to read the user account that belongs to the token with the /user-svc/user/by-token endpoint. Decoding the token​ The /user-svc/public-key will return you the public key of the User Svc which then you can use that to decode the token. Use the JWT libraries that are available in your programming language to do that, or use the Singularon SDK if your language is supported. Token structure​ The structure of the JWT is the following: { &quot;sui&quot;:&quot;usr_dC4K75Cbp6&quot;, &quot;slu&quot;:&quot;test-user-slug-0&quot;, &quot;sri&quot;:[ &quot;user-svc:user&quot;, &quot;user-svc:org:{org_dC4K7NNDCG}:user&quot; ] } The field names are kept short to save space, so perhaps the Go definition is also educational: type Claims struct { UserId string `json:&quot;sui&quot;` // `sui`: singulatron user ids Slug string `json:&quot;slu&quot;` // `slu`: singulatron slug RoleIds []string `json:&quot;sri&quot;` // `sri`: singulatron role ids jwt.RegisteredClaims } Roles​ Types of roles​ Static​ Static roles, such as user-svc:admin and user-svc:user defined by the User Svc are primarily used for simple role-based access control: in the Superplatform UI and API you can edit static roles to add or remove endpoints a user can call. If you are looking at restricting access to endpoints in other ways, you might be interested in: Policy Svc. Dynamic​ Dynamic roles are generated based on specific user-resource associations, offering more flexible permission management compared to static roles. Dynamic roles look like user-svc:org:{org_dBZRCej3fo}:admin. The dynamic values must be surrounded by {} symbols. The above example is how organization roles are represented. These dynamic roles, like static roles are stored in the JWT tokens so it is advisable to keep them to a minimum. The organization example is an apt one here: think about how many GitHub or Google organizations you are part of. Likely even a few dozen are at the most extreme upper limit. JWT tokens (and the dynamic they contain) are sent with each request, so try to be efficient with dynamic roles. Conventions​ Each role created must by prefixed by the slug of the account that created it. Said account becomes the owner of the role and only that account can edit the role. Permissions​ Conventions​ Each permission created must by prefixed by the slug of the account that created it. Said account becomes the owner of the permission and only that account can add the permission to a role. Once you (your service) own a permission (by creating it, and it being prefixed by your account slug), you can add it to any role, not just roles owned by you. Example; let's say your service is petstore-svc. Superplatform prefers fine-grained access control, so you are free to define your own permissions, such as petstore-svc:read or petstore-svc:pet:read.","keywords":"ai  llm  free gpt  gpt  open-source  open source  ai framework  ai server","version":"Next"},{"title":"Add Message","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"/docs/openorch/add-message","content":"Add Message POST /chat-svc/thread/:threadId/message Add a new message to a specific thread.

This envar is needed when OpenOrch runs as a container next to containers it starts: Host | |-&gt; OpenOrch Container |-&gt; Container Launched By OpenOrch For the containers like llama-cpp to be able to read the models downloaded by OpenOrch we they must both mount the same docker volume.

OPENORCH_LLM_HOST​ This flag is typically unnecessary since OpenOrch retrieves the IP of the Docker bridge. Use it only as a corrective action. When OpenOrch is running in a container, it needs to know how to address its siblings (other containers it started): Host | |-&gt; OpenOrch Container |-&gt; Container Launched By OpenOrch The OpenOrch Container uses the envar OPENORCH_LLM_HOST to address Container Launched By OpenOrch.

A service only needs a few things to fully function: Must register a user account. This is just like a human user account (for more info about this, see the User Svc)Must register its instance in the registry so OpenOrch knows how where to proxy the requests to. A Go example​ Below is an example Go service that does the following things: Registers a user for itself with the slug skeleton-svcRegisters/updates its own URL in the Registry. package main import ( &quot;context&quot; &quot;fmt&quot; &quot;log&quot; &quot;net/http&quot; &quot;os&quot; openapi &quot;github.com/openorch/openorch/clients/go&quot; sdk &quot;github.com/openorch/openorch/sdk/go&quot; &quot;github.com/pkg/errors&quot; ) func main() { skeletonService, err := NewService() if err != nil { log.Fatalf(&quot;Failed to initialize skeleton service: %v&quot;, err) } router := http.NewServeMux() router.HandleFunc(&quot;/skeleton-svc/hello&quot;, func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { skeletonService.Hello(w, r) }) log.Println(&quot;Server started on :9311&quot;) log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(&quot;:9311&quot;, router)) } type SkeletonService struct { token string } func NewService() (*SkeletonService, error) { spUrl := os.Getenv(&quot;OPENORCH_URL&quot;) if spUrl == &quot;&quot; { return nil, errors.New(&quot;OPENORCH_URL cannot be found&quot;) } selfUrl := os.Getenv(&quot;SELF_URL&quot;) dsf, err := sdk.NewDatastoreFactory(&quot;&quot;) if err != nil { return nil, errors.Wrap(err, &quot;cannot create datastore factory&quot;) } credentialStore, err := dsf(&quot;skeletonSvcCredentials&quot;, &amp;sdk.Credential{}) if err != nil { return nil, errors.Wrap(err, &quot;cannot create credential store&quot;) } client := sdk.NewApiClientFactory(spUrl).Client() token, err := sdk.RegisterService( client.UserSvcAPI, &quot;skeleton-svc&quot;, &quot;Skeleton Svc&quot;, credentialStore, ) if err != nil { return nil, errors.Wrap(err, &quot;cannot register service&quot;) } client = sdk.NewApiClientFactory(spUrl).Client(sdk.WithToken(token)) _, _, err = client.RegistrySvcAPI.RegisterInstance(context.Background()).Body(openapi.RegistrySvcRegisterInstanceRequest{ Url: selfUrl, }).Execute() if err != nil { return nil, errors.Wrap(err, &quot;cannot register instance&quot;) } repo := &amp;SkeletonService{ token: token, } return repo, nil } func (skeleton *SkeletonService) Hello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { fmt.Fprintf(w, `{&quot;hello&quot;: &quot;world&quot;}`) } Just make sure you run it with the appropriate envars: OPENORCH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:58231 SELF_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9311 go run main.go Once it's running you will be able to call the Superplatform daemon proxy and that will proxy to your skeleton service: # 127.0.0.1:58231 here is the address of the OpenOrch daemon $ curl 127.0.0.1:58231/skeleton-svc/hello {&quot;hello&quot;: &quot;world&quot;} This is so you don't have to expose your skeleton service to the outside world, only your Superplatform. Let's recap how the proxying works: Service registers an account, acquires the skeleton-svc slug.Service calls the OpenOrch Regustry Svc to tell the system an instance of the Skeleton service is available under the URL http://127.0.0.1:9311When you curl the OpenOrch daemon with a path like 127.0.0.1:58231/skeleton-svc/hello, the first section of the path will be a user account slug. The daemon checks what instances are owned by that slug and routes the request to one of the instances. $ oo instance ls ID URL STATUS OWNER SLUG LAST HEARTBEAT inst_eHFTNvAlk9 http://127.0.0.1:9311 Healthy skeleton-svc 10s ago Things to understand​ Instance registration​ Like most other things on the platform, service instances become owned by a user account slug. When the skeleton service calls RegisterInstance, the host will be associated with the skeleton-svc slug. Updates to this host won't be possible unless the caller is the skeleton service (or the caller is an admin). The service becomes the owner of that URL essentially. This is the same ownership model like in other parts of the OpenOrch system.","keywords":"ai  llm  free gpt  gpt  open-source  open source  ai framework  ai server","version":"Next"}],"options":{"id":"default"}}
