It goes beyond chat functionality, enabling you to develop language-agnostic applications by harnessing Singulatron's AI infrastructure. Dive in and start building today!

## Run On Your Servers

See [this document](./start/) to help you get started.

## Run On Your Laptop/PC

Download as a binary for your laptop or PC for Windows or Linux from the website: https://singulatron.com/home  
MacOS support is coming soon.

**Note/Troubleshooting**: currently the focus is on server setups. If the app doesn't want to work on your machine, just make sure Docker is running on your system, as the Docker/VM installation is not entirely reliable on every machine yet.
