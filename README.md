Superplatform is a microservices platform that first came to mind back in 2013 when I was working for an Uber competitor called Hailo. I shelved the idea, thinking someone else would eventually build it. Now, with the AI boom and all the AI apps we’re about to roll out, I’ve realized I’ll have to build it myself since no one else has.

It's a server and ecosystem enables you to self-host AI models, build apps that leverage those models in any language, and utilize a microservices-based communal backend designed to support a diverse range of projects.

## Primary Use Cases

- Run open-source AI models privately on your own infrastructure, ensuring that your data and operations remain fully under your control.
- Build backendless application by using Superplatform as a database and AI prompting API. Like Firebase, but with a focus on AI.
- Build your own backend services around Superplatform. Run these services outside or inside the Superplatform platform.
- Superplatform is designed to make deploying third-party AI applications straightforward. With its focus on virtualization and containers (primarily Docker) and a microservices, API-first approach (using OpenAPI), Superplatform seamlessly integrates other applications into its ecosystem.
