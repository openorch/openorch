Singulatron is an app that lets you run AI anywhere!
It is private, works offline, and can run on your laptop, PC, or even on your company computers or servers.

It's not just an app but also a platform that enables building other AI applications on top of it.

Download for Windows, MacOS or Linux: https://singulatron.com/home

## Why

We bought quite a few beefy GPUs for our servers but realized we need good software to be able to experiment quickly.
Singulatron aims to be both a desktop app for local usage and also work as a website to drive servers.

## Highlights

- Private: your chats never leave your computer
- Works without an internet connection
- The prompt queue system lets you input many prompts at once - even across threads - they will be processed sensibly. You can leave threads and return - streaming won't be interrupted
- A download manager makes sure your models are well kept
- Run as a binary (exe, deb etc) locally, or on your servers
