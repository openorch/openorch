# Welcome to OpenOrch

OpenOrch is a daemon that transforms your servers into a powerful development environment. It can run AI models, containers, and microservices. Think of it as a blend of (an extremely simplistic, early-stage) Kubernetes and a language agnostic backend framework for building applications on topâ€”designed for fixed-resource setups and straightforward self-hosting.

Whether you're deploying AI or building microservices, OpenOrch is your one-stop shop for creating and managing applications, all while keeping full control over your infrastructure and data.

## Running

The first step is to run the daemon. For details about that, see [Running the Daemon](./category/running-the-daemon/).

## Built-ins

For a quick overview about what the system is capable, read through the [Built-in Service Docs](./category/built-in-services).

## Building on top

To build and run your own services on OpenOrch, see [Your First Service](./writing-custom-services/your-first-service)
